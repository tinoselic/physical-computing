        I chose to work with the rotary dial mechanism and the idle switch of Matti’s red example telephone, because it
        is relevant for my final project. The idle switch is triggered when the handset is lifted or placed back on the
        telephone – basically like a simple button. For this reason I chose Arduino pin 2 to read its signal and added a
        10k resistor to prevent a short circuit. The rotary-dial on the other hand was harder to figure out. Matti
        explained to me that the dial returns a number of pulse signals depending on the number dialled. He knew which
        wires were the correct ones to read the signal of his telephone’s dial (red and blue). To be sure we tested the
        signal with the multimeter. With the knowledge gained I connected the dial’s wires with the breadboard and I
        chose Arduino pin 9 to read its signal.
        <br />
        <br />
        Like many other people, I find it difficult to get up early in the morning. Especially during autumn and winter
        here in Finland the days get really short and the mornings are dark. For this reason, I am using a light alarm
        clock (also called “wake-up light”) that makes it easier to wake up and get out of bed during dark times.
        Ideally, I manage to transform the telephone not only into an alarm clock but also into a light alarm clock.
        <br />
        <br />
        Must have:
        <br />
        The telephone must have a display that shows the time of clock and alarm. It must also have buttons for
        navigating (“Select” to switch between options and “Enter” to confirm the selection). The rotary dial must be
        used to set up the time of the clock and the alarm, and the original ringing sound of the telephone must be the
        alarm sound. Furthermore, picking up the phone must dismiss the alarm.
        <br />
        <br />
        Should have:
        <br />
        To turn the telephone into a wake-up light the telephone should also have a connection to a light source. 30
        minutes before the alarm, the light should start to brighten continuously like a sunrise until it is at full
        brightness, when the alarm goes off. A LED strip should work well for this.
        <br />
        <br />
        Could have:
        <br />
        The telephone could have options to turn the light on and off and maybe even to adjust the brightness of the
        light. These information could be shown on the display.
        <br />
        Another extention could be to replace the build-in speaker and mikrophone of the phone with two bigger / louder
        speakers. I could then choose any audio I like to play as the alarm sound.

        I came up with the idea for my project, when Matti introduced the rotary dial mechanisms of old telephones and
        how they can be used as potential inputs. I want to turn an old rotary dial telephone into an alarm clock and
        this is how it is supposed to work: the rotary dial is used to set up the time of the alarm. When the alarm goes
        off, the telephone starts ringing and it only stops, when the phone is picked up.

        “FLUX is an alt.arcade reaction game, where players compete against one another to hit 5 buttons in the right
        order as quickly as possible.”
        <br />
        <a href="wethrowswitches.com/flux">wethrowswitches.com/flux</a>
        <br />
        <br />
        This project caught my attention because it seems simple but fun and it looks cool. Judging by the pictures this
        game could very well be placed at festivals or in bars/nightclubs as the surface seems sturdy and can act as a
        table for glasses etc. FLUX uses buttons and lights – the first components we started to work with in the
        beginning of this course.
        <br />

        </iframe>
        <br />
        <br />
        FLUX’s game design is based on the 80’s classic “Simon”, where the player has to memorize and repeat a pattern
        by hitting the correct buttons of the device. With every successful repetition, the game is getting harder.
        <br />
        <br />
        Both FLUX and Simon use buttons as inputs and lights as outputs. Wouldn’t it be interesting if this mechanic
        could be somehow reversed? Replacing buttons with photoresistors turns light into an input.
        <br />
        This could be realized with a monitor made of multiple photoresistors arranged in a grid. A separate screen
        would display a specific pattern or shape for a limited time. The player would then have to memorize the image
        and recreate it by using a flashlight as a controller to “draw” on the light sensor monitor. Just like in Simon,
        this game would get harder with every successful repetition as the images would get more and more complex.

        <br />
        With the knowledge I remembered from class, high school physics class and my first (unsuccessful) studies in
        electrical engineering, I started to draw a first circuit diagram. I then collected the parts I needed and built
        the circuit according to my drawing. I chose to work with digital pins 2 and 4, because they didn’t have the ~
        symbol. I haven’t figured out what that symbol stands for, I’m guessing it’s alternating current (AC). Also, I
        didn’t know how to involve the connection to the Arduino in my circuit drawing at this point.
        <br />
        <br />
        I pressed the button, but nothing happened. I checked the board and it turned out that the LEDs were pointing
        the wrong direction – a problem I still run into often. I fixed the problem and both LEDs turned on, when I
        pressed the button. A first small success, but not really the expected outcome of the assignment. When I opened
        up the Arduino programming software and tried to access LEDs and the button with the Arduino pins, I realized
        that I was missing a lot of theoretical understanding. Fortunately, Matti provided a clear and comprehensive
        <a href="https://learn.newmedia.dog/tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/arduino/">tutorial on the course
          website</a>, that provided all the information I needed to complete the assignment.
        <br />
        <br />
        I learned how to set up the circuit properly, reading the signals from the LEDs and the button and storing
        signal changes as states. The final challenge for me was figuring out the correct syntax of my code. The key was
        understanding how to save the button state as pressed and released.

// A button that first turns on one LED, then another, and then turns both LEDs off again

int btnState = false;

int counter = 0;

  pinMode(btnPin, INPUT);

    if (btnState == HIGH) {
      Serial.println("Light 1 on, Light 2 off");
      digitalWrite(ledPin1, HIGH);
      digitalWrite(ledPin2, LOW);
